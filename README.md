# Crypto Tracker
## Why This App?
Over the last few months, cryptocurrency has made headway into mainstream discussions, and many coins have had incredible growth this year. Investing in well-known coins--like BTC and ETH--as well as altcoins--like DOGE, ALGO, and LTC--offers a great chance at profitable returns in both the short and long term. While many crypto exchanges already exist to assist users in trading cryptocurrencies and managing their portfolio, many lack additional features that would benefit traders. This application seeks to present extra details and statistics to users about their crypto transactions, as well as providing helpful notifications and updates about cryptocurrency prices.
